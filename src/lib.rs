//! # Nazgul
//! A library that implements [Ring Signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature). The following schemes have been implemented based on [Chapter 3 of Zero to Monero 2.0 (Z2M2)](https://www.getmonero.org/library/Zero-to-Monero-2-0-0.pdf):
//!
//!  - Spontaneous Anonymous Group (SAG) signatures
//!  - Backâ€™s Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group (bLSAG) signatures
//!  - Multilayer Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group (MLSAG) signatures
//!  - Concise Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group (CLSAG) signatures
//!
//!  > All blockquotes (except this one) in this documentation are from [Z2M2](https://www.getmonero.org/library/Zero-to-Monero-2-0-0.pdf)
//!
//!  This library is to work with any 512-bit (64 byte output) hashing function. But it uses the
//!  [Ristretto elliptic curve](https://doc.dalek.rs/curve25519_dalek/ristretto/) for ease of use and better security.
//!
//!  This library is `#![no_std]` by default so it is possible to compile this library for embedded devices and WebAssembly but we haven't tried.
